# GitHub-Simulation-
The GitHub Simulation Application is a C++ based project that simulates key functionalities of the popular version control platform GitHub. It allows users to perform various operations such as user registration, repository management, file manipulation, commit tracking, user interaction, and more, all within a command-line interface.


**Project Overview:**

The project is a command-line-based GitHub application that simulates several functionalities of the actual GitHub platform. It allows users to register, log-in, create repositories, manage files and commits, follow/unfollow other users, and perform repository-related operations like forking and deletion. The project uses C++ and leverages object-oriented programming principles to create a modular and scalable system.


**Key Features:**

1) User Registration and Login:
- Users can register with a unique username and password.
- The application ensures registration success and handles login authentication securely.

2) Repository Management:
- Users can create repositories with specified names and privacy settings (private/public).
- Deleting repositories is also supported, maintaining data consistency.

3) Forking and Collaboration:
- The application supports forking repositories from other users, enabling collaborative development.
- Users can view their own and others' profiles, facilitating community interaction.

4) File and Commit Operations:
- Files can be added to repositories, managed, and deleted as needed.
- Commits can be added with unique hash values and associated messages, providing version control.

5) User Interaction:
- Users can follow/unfollow other users, enhancing social networking within the platform.
- The application ensures user-friendly interaction with clear menus and input prompts.


**Technical Implementation:**

The project uses multiple classes such as Commit, File, Repository, User, Hash, AVL, Graph, and GitHub. These classes encapsulate various functionalities and data structures required for the GitHub simulation. Notably, the use of AVL trees for efficient data storage and retrieval, along with graph structures for user relationships, adds robustness to the application.

The main function (main()) orchestrates user interactions through a console interface, providing a seamless experience for registering, logging in, and navigating the application's features. Color-coded text and visual cues enhance the user interface's readability and aesthetics.


**Conclusion and Future Enhancements:**

Overall, the GitHub project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of version control concepts and user management within a simulated GitHub environment. Future enhancements could include: Implementing more advanced commit functionalities like branching and merging. Enhancing user profiles with additional information and customization options. Integrating real-time notifications and activity feeds for better user engagement. The project serves as a solid foundation for learning and exploring advanced software development principles, especially in the context of version control systems and collaborative programming workflows.
